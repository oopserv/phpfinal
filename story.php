        <h3>Short Bio</h3>
          <p>
          After moving from Little Rock, Arkansas to Wichita, Kansas in 1995, I've come across all kinds of situation and met all sort of 
          interesting people who have helped shaped me into the person I am today.
          I am currently in the spring semester at Butler CC.  I am taking 5 classes this semester and it is going well.  
          I will have 2 classe to take this semester before I earn my associates degree in software development.
          I must say that my attention has been drawn to web development lately.  I'm having a lot of fun learning
          web technologies and think I will continue expanding my web development skills in the future.
        </p>

          My hope is that I can gain employment at a small company performing the duties of maintaining and or creating web pages and applications.  
          I know that there are tons of small companies who feel they cannot afford to pay top dollar for a professionally built website. I want to 
          make this a reality by provoding quality work within agreed timed perameters. With a small team, I also look to provide mobile app assitance. With
          experience working with both android and iOS projects, I am well equipped to resolved any problems that may arrise due to device issues, version control,
          portability concerns or any other issues that are common when dealing with the young and ever changing mobile environments.
